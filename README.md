### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- A code editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.) if you want to modify the code.

## API Integration
The Translate Web App uses the MyMemory API for translation services. This API provides a robust and reliable way to translate text with a large database of translations. 

### How It Works

- The API processes the request and returns the translated text.
- The app displays the translation in real-time.

### API Key
For advanced usage, you might need to register for an API key. Check the [MyMemory API documentation](https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/spec.php) for more details.
